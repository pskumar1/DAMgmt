#Activity Definition:

![Activity Definition](ActivityDefinition.png)

## Setup:

```{r}
#Load the required libraries for data analysis.
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

## Analysis:

### Write down 3 questions that you might want to answer based on this data.

__Which city had more number of people participated in the poll ?__ 

__What is the Age group  with highest, lowest support for Cullen from each city ?__ 

__What is the proportion of the age groups participated in the polls ?__ 

__What is the overall support for Cullen ?__


### Create an R data frame with 2 observations to store this data in its current "messy" state. Use whatever method you want to re-create and/or load the data.

```{r}
response = c("Yes", "No")
edinburgh.16_24 = c(80100, 35900)
edinburgh.25_plus = c(143000, 214800)
glasgow.16_24 = c(99400, 43000)
glasgow.25_plus = c(150400, 207000)

data_orig <- tbl_df(data.frame(response, edinburgh.16_24, edinburgh.25_plus, glasgow.16_24, glasgow.25_plus))
colnames(data_orig)[1] <- "prefer_cullen"
 
data_orig
```


### Use the functionality in the tidyr package to convert the data frame to be "tidy data."

```{r}
data_tidy <- data_orig %>%
              gather(key = city_agegroup, value = count, -prefer_cullen) %>%
                separate(col = city_agegroup, into=c("city", "agegroup"), sep = "\\.")

data_tidy
```


### Use the functionality in the dplyr package to answer the questions that you asked previously.

__Which city had more number of people participated in the poll ?__ 

```{r}
data_tidy %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
    summarise(total = sum(count)) %>%
      arrange(desc(total)) %>%
        top_n(1) 

```


__What is the Age group  with highest, lowest support for Cullen from each city ?__ 

```{r}
data_tidy %>%
  filter(prefer_cullen == 'Yes') %>%
    group_by(city, agegroup) %>%
     summarise(total = sum(count)) %>%
              top_n(1, total) 

data_tidy %>%
  filter(prefer_cullen == 'Yes') %>%
    group_by(city, agegroup) %>%
      summarise(total = sum(count)) %>%
        top_n(1, desc(total))

```


__What is the proportion of the age groups participated in the polls ?__ 

```{r}
age_16_24  <- data_tidy %>%
                    filter(agegroup == '16_24') %>% 
                        summarise(total = sum(count))


age_25_plus <- data_tidy %>%
                    filter(agegroup == '25_plus') %>% 
                        summarise(total = sum(count))



paste(round((age_16_24)/sum(data_tidy$count) * 100,2) , '% of population is between 16 and 24')

paste(round((age_25_plus)/sum(data_tidy$count) * 100,2), '% of population is between 25 and above')

```


__What is the overall support for Cullen ?__

```{r}
prefer_cullen  <- data_tidy %>%
  filter(prefer_cullen == 'Yes') %>% 
      summarise(total = sum(count))

do_not_prefer_cullen <- data_tidy %>%
    filter(prefer_cullen == 'No') %>% 
      summarise(total = sum(count))

paste(round((prefer_cullen)/sum(data_tidy$count) * 100,2) , '% of population prefer Cullen')
paste(round((do_not_prefer_cullen)/sum(data_tidy$count) * 100,2) , '% of population do NOT prefer Cullen')

```


From the above analysis, it appears like Partan Bree has got slightly more support than Cullen Skink. With the given data, 
the above tidy data set appears to be sufficient for this analysis, however it gets tricky when we need to anwer questions 
based on the mulitple factors like age group, city. Probably by combining age groups could simplify the data frame to look 
at just the majority preference in each city and overall.
